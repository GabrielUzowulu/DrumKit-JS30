# DrumKit-JS30
My first Vanilla JS project. This project is kinda silly but I did it for fun. Create some wonderful Drum beatsðŸ˜‰

## PS:
This project was the first of my JavaScript30 projects with [@Wesbos's](https://github.com/wesbos) ---> [JavaScript30](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30) program. Do well to check it out if you're interested in creating amazing projects like this in JavaScript.

## PPS
The GitHUb hosted link doesn't quite do justice to the project, therefore you can download the repo and run it on your browser for full effect. I'll edit this repo once I'm able to to host it on my netlify page. Thanks

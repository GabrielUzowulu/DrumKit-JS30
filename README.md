# DrumKit-JS30
My first Vanilla JS project. This project is kinda silly but I did it for fun. Create some wonderful Drum beatsðŸ˜‰

## PS:
This project was the first of my JavaScript30 projects with [@Wesbos's](https://github.com/wesbos) ---> [JavaScript30](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30) program. Do well to check it out if you're interested in creating amazing projects like this.
